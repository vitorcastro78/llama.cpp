> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is the PrismML fork of llama.cpp**, the main line behind the [Bonsai](https://huggingface.co/collections/prism-ml/bonsai) models (branch `prism`, developed as `prism-v7`). It tracks current mainline llama.cpp and adds the fork's low-bit formats and runtime features on top.
>
> **New here? Start with the [Bonsai-demo](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/Bonsai-demo) repo.** It downloads the right models and the correct prebuilt binaries for your hardware/backend automatically.
>
> **Which ternary model file to use:**
>
> - `*-PQ2_0.gguf` (fork group-128, ggml id 142): preferred on Metal, CUDA, HIP and CPU. About 6% smaller than group-64.
> - `*-Q2_0_g64.gguf` / 27B `*-Q2_g64.gguf` (official group-64, ggml id 42): runs on every backend here AND on mainline llama.cpp. If unsure, use this. Newer model releases name this file plain `*-Q2_0.gguf`.
> - `*-Q2_0.gguf` on OLDER model repos is the **deprecated legacy format** (group 128 stored as id 42). It does not load on these builds; the error tells you which file to get instead. If you must run it, use the frozen [`prism-v5`](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp/tree/prism-v5) line and its final release [`prism-b9601`](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp/releases/tag/prism-b9601-68faa14).
>
> **Speculative decoding (dspark)** is supported via mainline's draft-dspark plus fork patches. Drafters published for older model releases need a one-time conversion with `gguf-dspark-to-dflash` (see [SPECULATIVE.md](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/Bonsai-demo/blob/main/SPECULATIVE.md) in Bonsai-demo); newer releases ship ready-to-use drafters.
>
> Do NOT build from `prism-v6` (stale mid-migration snapshot) and do NOT mix this fork's `ggml-*` libraries with a stock llama.cpp build.

LLM inference in C/C++

## ⚡ This fork — Fable's MoE-offload prefill optimizations

Two **opt-in** optimizations for large MoE models whose experts are offloaded to system RAM
(`--n-cpu-moe`), found and implemented by Fable. Both are **off by default**, toggled via
environment variables, and produce **token-identical** output to mainline.

| Env var | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `GGML_CUDA_REGISTER_HOST=1` | Page-locks (pins) the mmap'd CPU expert weights so host→device copies go straight over DMA instead of through the driver's hidden bounce buffer (~6–7 → ~20 GB/s). |
| `GGML_SCHED_PREFETCH_EXPERTS=1` | Prefetches each layer's experts on a second CUDA stream, so the weight uploads overlap compute instead of stalling the GPU. |

### Benchmark

Measured on an **RTX 3060 12GB** with **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** (`--n-cpu-moe 26`), prompt-processing at 2048 (`MODEL` = path to your `.gguf`):

```bash
# baseline (patches off):
./build/bin/llama-bench -m MODEL -ngl 99 -ncmoe 26 -p 2048 -n 0 -r 5 -b 2048 -ub 2048

# patched (both optimizations on):
GGML_CUDA_REGISTER_HOST=1 GGML_SCHED_PREFETCH_EXPERTS=1 \
./build/bin/llama-bench -m MODEL -ngl 99 -ncmoe 26 -p 2048 -n 0 -r 5 -b 2048 -ub 2048
```

Result: **~1143 → ~1880 t/s** prefill (**+64%**) — same GPU, same settings, token-identical.

Branches: [`fable5/host-register`](https://github.com/thecodacus/llama.cpp/tree/fable5/host-register) (pinning only) · [`fable5/prefetch-experts`](https://github.com/thecodacus/llama.cpp/tree/fable5/prefetch-experts) (both — this branch).

## ⚡ This fork — MoE expert cache (VRAM-resident hot experts)

For MoE models whose routed experts live in system RAM (`--n-cpu-moe`), this fork can keep the
most-frequently-routed experts of each layer **resident in VRAM**. Decode runs the hot experts on
GPU and only the cold remainder on CPU; the two halves are merged exactly, so output is
**bit-identical** to baseline. Opt-in, off by default.

Measured on an RTX 3060 12GB (`-ngl 99 -ncmoe 99 -fa 1`):

| Model | Baseline tg | Cached tg | Prefill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M (256 experts/layer) | 42.3 | **51.3 (+21%)** @ 124 slots | +14% |
| — same, stacked with `--spec-type draft-mtp` | 41.7 | **69.3 (+66%)** @ 112 slots | — |
| — same, plus async CPU splits (default on) | 41.7 | **74.2 (+78%)** @ 88 slots | — |
| GLM-4.7-Flash Q4_K_M (64 experts/layer) | 32.1 | **46.3 (+44%)** @ 40 slots | +64% |
| Laguna-S-2.1-118B-A8B IQ4_XS (256 experts/layer) | 11.5 | **12.1 (+5%)** @ 36 slots | +12% |

Supported architectures: `qwen35moe`, `deepseek2`, `laguna` (plain fused-SILU gated expert FFN,
separate gate/up/down tensors). Other architectures run unchanged.

### Quick start

**1. Capture a routing profile** (one time per model — records which experts the router picks):

```bash
MOE_TRACE_OUT=mymodel-code.csv ./build/bin/llama-moe-trace -m model.gguf \
  -ngl 99 -ncmoe 99 -fa 1 -c 4096 -n 512 -p "<a code-flavored prompt>"

MOE_TRACE_OUT=mymodel-chat.csv ./build/bin/llama-moe-trace -m model.gguf \
  -ngl 99 -ncmoe 99 -fa 1 -c 4096 -n 512 -p "<a chat-flavored prompt>"

cat mymodel-code.csv mymodel-chat.csv > mymodel-merged.csv
```

512 generated tokens per prompt is enough. Merge traces from contrasting workloads — a merged
profile measures within 1% of per-workload specialist profiles, so one merged CSV per model is
all you need.

**2. Serve with the cache:**

```bash
./build/bin/llama-server -m model.gguf -ngl 99 -ncmoe 99 -fa 1 \
  --moe-cache-profile mymodel-merged.csv --moe-cache-slots 112
```

Also works per model in a `--models-preset` INI section (`moe-cache-profile = ...`,
`moe-cache-slots = ...`), and as env vars `LLAMA_ARG_MOE_CACHE_PROFILE` / `LLAMA_ARG_MOE_CACHE_SLOTS`
(or legacy `GGML_MOE_CACHE_PROFILE` / `GGML_MOE_CACHE_SLOTS`, which `llama-bench` also accepts).

**3. Confirm it engaged** — look for this line at load:

```
init_moe_expert_cache: expert cache: 40 layers x 112 slots, 8164.00 MiB uploaded to CUDA0
```

A warning instead of this line means the cache fell back to baseline (see Tuning).

### Tuning

- **`--moe-cache-slots` is the main knob** — experts cached per layer. Throughput rises with slot
  count until the pack no longer fits in VRAM. The pack is all-or-nothing: an oversized request
  logs `pack allocation failed - expert cache disabled` and runs at baseline speed (it does not
  partially fill). The warning reports the per-slot cost and the maximum count that could fit —
  set slots to that, minus headroom for KV/compute buffers which allocate afterwards.
- **The cold and hot chains overlap by default.** CPU graph splits run on a worker thread so the
  GPU hot chain executes concurrently with the CPU cold chain (`--no-sched-async-cpu` to disable;
  `llama-bench --sched-async-cpu 0,1` benches both). Worth +4-5% with speculative decoding, ~±2%
  without it; outputs stay bit-identical either way.
- **Leave ~900 MB of VRAM free beyond the pack.** A slot count that loads can still crash on the
  first large prompt: runtime CUDA pool growth allocates beyond what the load-time check sees.
  Size slots against the biggest prompt you will serve, not against "it loaded".
- **Fill VRAM to just under the ceiling, don't sweat the split.** Near the maximum, a marginal MB
  is worth about the same as cache slots or as fully-resident layers (lower `--n-cpu-moe`).
  Pure `-ncmoe 99` + max slots is the simple default; a hybrid (e.g. `-ncmoe 30` + fewer slots)
  buys ~1% decode and ~3% prefill at best.
- **Context size competes with the pack.** KV grows with `-c` and shrinks the viable slot count.
  Compressing the KV cache (`-ctk`/`-ctv`, e.g. TurboQuant types) frees VRAM that converts
  directly into slots — often worth more than the KV precision costs.
- **Speculative decoding stacks multiplicatively.** `--spec-type draft-mtp` composes with the
  cache (+48% cache × +12% MTP ≈ +66% on Qwen); reserve ~1 GB for the draft context by dropping
  a few slots.
- **Expert size decides the payoff.** Big experts (GLM: ~5 MiB each) gain the most per slot;
  small experts need high slot counts before the win beats the dual-path overhead (~25% traffic
  coverage is roughly break-even). If VRAM only fits <15% of the expert count, expect single-digit
  gains (Laguna above).
- **Profiles are model-specific, workload-tolerant.** A wrong-workload profile still helps
  (+28% measured on Qwen worst-case) but loses about half the win; the merged profile recovers
  nearly all of it. Regenerate only if your usage changes character entirely.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `cannot open profile '...'` | Path not visible to the process (e.g. not mounted into the container). |
| `pack allocation failed` | Slot count too big — read the fit math in the warning and reduce. |
| `no CPU-resident MoE layers` | Experts are already on GPU (no `--n-cpu-moe`) — nothing to cache. |
| No init line, no warning | Architecture not wired for the cache — model runs unchanged. |
| Model loads, then context creation OOMs | Pack fits but KV/compute don't — drop a few slots or shrink/compress KV. |

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM (and VLM) inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on
a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is build on top of the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.
